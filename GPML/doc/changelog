Changes and small incremental bug fixes applied since last release.
- bugfix in infVB marginal likelihood for likLogistic with nonzero mean function as reported by James Lloyd
- removed the combination likErf/infVB as it yields a bad posterior approximation and lacks theoretical justification
- Matlab and Octave compilation for L-BFGS-B v2.4 and the more recent L-BFGS-B v3.0 as contrubuted by Jose Vallet
- bugfix due to Bj√∏rn Sand Jensen noticing that cov_deriv_sq_dist.m was missing in the distribution
- bugfix due to Joris Mooij in gp.m where the wrong mode for post.L was chosen when using infFITC and post.L being a diagonal matrix
- updated use of logphi in lik/likErf
- bugfix in util/solve_chol.c due to Todd Small where a typing issue occured on OS X
- bugfix in lik/likBeta.m due to Dali Wei
